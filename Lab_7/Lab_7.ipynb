    "**What is the difference between bzip2 and pbzip2? Do you expect one to be faster and why?** <br> pbzip2 runs significantly faster than bzip2. bzip2 compresses files of mostly zeroes better than pbzip2. pbzip is faster because it runs in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does the level of compression change as the percentage of zeros increases? Why does this happen?**<br> The compression of the file becomes less effective as the percentage of zeroes increases. This is because there are fewer sections of uninterrupted entries of the same kind that could be compressed.\n",

The protein sequence was at 60.6 MB for gzip and 55.3 MB for bzip2 instead of the ideal 50 MB to encode 100MB of protein data. gzip and bzip2 perform better on the DNA than the protein.\n",

    "Incentivized by this bonus, your team gets to work determining which compression algorithm will generate the most savings. The algorithm you choose must either be quick enough to compress 1000 terabytes a day, or efficient enough that even if all the data isn’t compressed, the savings are maximized by the data that you have time to compress.<br><br>\n",
    "Let’s make some assumptions about the contents of the data at your biotech company. Most of the data, say 80%, is re-sequencing of genomes and plasmids that are very similar to each other. Another 10% might be protein sequences, and the last 10% are binary microscope images which we’ll assume follow the worst-case scenario of being completely random.<br><br>\n",
    "**Given the benchmarking data you obtained in this lab, which algorithm do you propose to use for each type of data? Provide an estimate for the fraction of space you can save using your compression scheme. How much of a bonus do you anticipate receiving this year?** <br>\n",

    "For **re-sequencing of similar genomes**, I would use **pbzip2** for parallel compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **protein sequences**,I would also use **pbzip2** would also work fastest among the algorithms, and provide approximately the same compression as gzip2.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last 10% of **completely random binary microscope images**, **gzip2** provides marginally the best compression (usually for most random sequences).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can see approximately 85% data storage savings on 80% of the genome data, 70% data storage savings when compressing the 10% protein sequences, and at worst 3% savings when compressing the 10% random images. Thus, it is estimated that a savings of around **78% data storage and thus a $39,000 every day** will be done using this compression scheme."
